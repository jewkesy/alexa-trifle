# alexa-trifle
An Alexa Skill trivia game that tests your knowledge against the Alexa community.

## Short Skill Description
Three questions. Three difficulties. You versus the world!

## Full Skill Description
You will be asked three questions from a random selection of categories with increasing difficulty, but increasing score.

Questions are answered either by "true" or "false", or multi-choice.  For multi-choice, answer using "a", b", "c" or "d" after listening to the choices.

Correctly answering 'Easy' gives you 1 points.
Correctly answering 'Medium' gives you 2 points.
Correctly answering 'Hard' gives you 3 points.

Each correct answer awards 1 bonus point.
So 2 correct answers (eg Easy and Hard) will award you a score of 6 points.
So 3 correct answers will award you a maximum of 9 points.

Alexa will keep your score and tell you your world ranking position compared against other Alexa players.

The more games you play and the more questions you answer correctly, the greater chance to increase your world rank.
